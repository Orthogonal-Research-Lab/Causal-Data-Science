### Ideas for Submission:

* lineage tree connected to a spatial network/connectome. Developmental processing (causality is built into the developmental process).

* application of Meta-brain model: layering as a information-building mechanism.

* Gibsonian Information application: motion cues and multisensory integration as a disambiguator.


Meta-brain models: layering as a information-building mechanism.

* meta-brain: combine two or more models in a "layered" fashion.

* layering involves two or more distinct levels of representation: lower levels are models with little to no representational content, while higher levels are representation-rich models. 

In the following example, a three-layer model of intelligent behavior will be presented: 

* developmental Braitenberg Vehicles (dBVs): little representational content, processing capacity. An expansive neural network that contains multiple layers between the sensor and effector.

* sitting above this, we have an observer-dependent model (representation of viewpoints).

* sitting above this, we have a representation-heavy model of context (CGS models).

How do we represent the interface between layers? Orthogonal to the layers of our neural network in the dBV.
